# epever-data-logger

I have my small photovoltaic installation on my balcony. It's central point is Epever Tracer solar charger controller. I also have original eLog-01 device, which should log data from regulator, but I have problems with it. It's very unstable and I have problems with downloading data. So I decided to build my own solar data logger.


More informations soon :)
